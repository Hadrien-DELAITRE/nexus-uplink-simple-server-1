Nexus Uplink Simple Server
==========================

For a description of the Nexus Uplink see the (client repo)[https://www.github.com/elierotenberg/nexus-uplink-client].

This package provides a simple, straighforward, single-process implementation of the Nexus Uplink Simple Server.
It was mainly designed to serve as a test implementation due its limited scaling capabilities, however, it should
perform very well in small- to medium- scale setups (few thousands of concurrent users each making several requests per second).
